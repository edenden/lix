TODO:
debug) fix dataplene packet udp checksum is added unexpectedly in some environment
module) copy TTL from outer header to inner header in ETR!
lispd)parse config
	->implement static map-cache
	->add address to rloc0 automatically
	->add -c argument to determine config file
lispd)improve control-plane 
	(e.g. multiple rloc map-request)
	(e.g. parse multiple rloc in map-reply)
module)multiple rloc(weight and priority)

Bug fix
comment outed "wake_up_interruptible"
changed flags from GFP_ATOMIC to GFP_KERNEL in control-plane to reduce failing to allocate memory space for new route information
changed spin_lock to spin_lock_irq to reduce deadlock
changed all flags from GFP_ATOMIC to GFP_KERNEL
changed spin_lock_irq to spin_lock_bh to reduce deadlock
fixed TTL handling at cache information insertion
change flag to GFP_ATOMIC in critical section(when holding spin_lock)
  See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1718667
change all flag to GFP_ATOMIC because all kmalloc is executed in interrupt context
  normal -> GFP_KERNEL
  interrupt -> GFP_ATOMIC
